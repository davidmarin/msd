- add "parent_brand" field for brands that have have other brands from

  For example, "HP" and "Hewlett-Packard" refer to the same brand.
  - probably need company_alias, brand_alias tables
- infer brand ratings from company ratings & brand list, mark as such
- filter out incorrect brands
  - try not to use climate_counts if we can avoid it
  - always include rated brands
- represent subsidiary relationships
- category hierarchy
- match up orphaned brands to companies (e.g. Labor 411)
